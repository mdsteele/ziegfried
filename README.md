**Ziegfried** ("Zig-`free()`-d") is a general-purpose memory allocator for the
[Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org), loosely based on the
principles of [Hoard: A Scalable Memory Allocator for Multithreaded
Applications](www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/papers/asplos-2000.pdf)
by Emery D. Berger, Kathryn S. McKinley, Robert D. Blumofe, and Paul R. Wilson,
and with some additional influence from
[Miser - A Dynamically Loadable Memory Allocator for Multi-Threaded
Applications](https://web.archive.org/web/20130801222545/http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/miser-a-dynamically-loadable-memory-allocator-for-multi-threaded-applications)
by Barry Tannenbaum.

Ziegfried is still under developement.
